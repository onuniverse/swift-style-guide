# Contributing to the Official Universe Swift Style Guide.

This style guide is a living document that evolves with the Swift language. We created this style guide to keep our team consistent across all our Swift projects. It prioritizes readability and longevity over cleverness and brevity.

We appreciate and encourage contributions from the team that improve this document. This document outlines the process for making contributions to the guide.

## Submitting Changes 

Anyone writing Swift at Universe is expected to follow all of the rules in this style guide unless special circumstances apply. Because of this, we welcome suggestions from anyone on the team. We may not all agree but consistency is worth each of us learning a few new habits.
### Step 1: Open a Pull Request

Open an pull request on github with the change you would like to see or rule that you would like to have added. Include some context as to why you think its valuable to change or add.
### Step 2: Wait for Team Feedback

Wait for feedback on the change. Even if the feedback is negative, don't close the pull request too quickly. Often times the discussion itself can be useful and give way to something even better. Style guides are very subjective and it is important to always be respectful. We expect participants to follow the same community guidelines as the Swift project itself outlined at [contributor-covenant.org](http://contributor-covenant.org)
### Step 3: Review Team Feedback.

If the team feedback was overwhelmingly positive, the change is approved. Congratulations on your first Universe style contribution!

If the team feedback was mostly negative and there was enough discussion for everyone to be certain in their feelings, then the change probably isn't right for the team. Better luck next time.

If the team feedback is mixed and discussion hasn't clearly swayed enough people for or against then we may need some tie breakers. Alert Marcus Smith about a stalemate discussion and he will take action. He has several tools at his disposal. He can privately confer with team leads and the most senior engineers to see if there is a consensus there. He can run a poll in Slack for everyone writing Swift at Universe and let democracy decide. Or if none of that is decisive, Marcus Smith can break the tie with his own preference. In Marcus we trust.

### Step 4: Merge the PR

Anyone with Github permissions to merge PRs for the Style Guide may merge team approved PRs.
